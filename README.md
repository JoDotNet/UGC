### Using UGC

1. Enter your Gas Price.
2. Enter the amount of percent the tank is on.
3. Press OK (Graphics Version) or Enter (Console Version).

### Example


<pre><code>Current Gas Price: 0.63
Tank Level: 30

Total Price: 44.1
</code></pre>


### How it works

Firstly when a user inputs his "Gas Price" it gets converted into a float value, because gas prices usually have comma values. UGC then finds out the percent it has to fill by taking 100 (total) and deducting their "Tank Level" which then gets multiplied by the "Gas Price".

### Features

- Standard CMD Window
- Graphical UI
- Simplistic Design & Easy to Understand

### Upcomming Features
